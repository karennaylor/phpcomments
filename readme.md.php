Allow visitors to add comments to your site in a pretty simple way.
Users do not need to register to leave comments.
These scripts will not style your comments for you, I am simply providing a way to save comments to a web page.
Installation notes can be found in the file installation.php

Current wishlist of features to add:
	* Report inappropriate comments.
	* Script to move comments to a new page if the url gets changed.
